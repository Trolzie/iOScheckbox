# ios-checkbox
A checkbox which looks and acts like the iOS device checkbox.
The checkboxes are pure HTML and CSS. No javascript is used to create the desired iOS look and feel.

See how it works in the browser by going to the <a href="http://trolzie.github.io/ios-checkbox/">demo page</a>.

The checkbox is built honoring the webstandards for HTML. If you remove all stlying, they will appear and work as they should by default.
